Encodings
Hello! For those of you, who prefer text to video I suggest you to read these two articles about encodings:

The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)
What every programmer absolutely, positively needs to know about encodings and character sets to work with text
They tell about what encodings are, why we need them and what unicode is. Some of you may find these articles a better explanation of a material, some of you may use them as additional material, to strengthen your knowledge of concept covered this week.

Number systems
This week we also slightly brought up a topic of numeral systems. For those of you who are not really familiar with the concept, and who are eager to get a better understanding, try this article:

Number Systems: An Introduction to Binary, Hexadecimal, and More
And it doesn't matter, whether you understand numeral systems or you don't, in any way this numeral systems converer is going to be useful to you:
